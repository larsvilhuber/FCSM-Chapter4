\begin{abstract}
When releasing data to the public, statistical agencies and survey
organizations typically alter data values in order to protect the
confidentiality of survey respondents' identities and attribute
values.  To select among the wide variety of data alteration
methods, agencies require tools for evaluating the utility of
proposed data releases.  Such utility measures can be combined
with disclosure risk measures to gauge risk-utility tradeoffs of
competing methods.  Some examples of utility metrics are presented in this Chapter.
A  decision-theoretic formulation for evaluating
disclosure limitation procedures based on utility and risk metrics is outlined
as well. Finally, examples of utility assessments of certain families of SDL methods are given.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec.intro}

As it was described in Chapter 3, there is a wide range of \gls{SDL} techniques.
These \gls{SDL} techniques can be implemented with differing degrees of
intensity.  Generally, increasing the amount of alteration
decreases the risk of disclosure, but it also decreases the
accuracy of inferences obtainable from the released data, often
referred to as data utility \citep{Hund10}.

\gls{SDL} techniques are not applied in isolation - they are used within the context of a particular data dissemination strategy, such as via a \gls{data-enclave} or as \gls{public-use_data}. Furthermore, multiple \gls{SDL} techniques may be applied at various stages of the data dissemination strategy. For instance, \gls{coarsening} might be applied to files made available through a \gls{physical-data-enclave}, with \gls{rounding} applied to the model parameters that researchers would like to publish. Thus, when evaluating utility, we consider the final public output product - after all output controls. Figure~\ref{fig:framework} illustrates the data flow from confidential data to output product, going through  mechanisms that are combinations of ``access control'' methods (``Safe settings'', ``Safe people'', ``Safe projects'') and ``SDL methods'' (``safe data'' and ``safe outputs''). (terminology from the five safes framework \parencite{desai_five_2016}.

% Here: start removing from here or drastically reducing, we may just say that 
% such and such methods have generally such and such utility or compare in such a way with other methods,
% say noise is better than mixroaggregation and microaggregation is better than swapping - or simething like that.
