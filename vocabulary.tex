Congress made major statutory changes to Title 26 in 1939, 1954, and 1986. Because of the extensive revisions made in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Title 26 is now known as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99-514, \P 2, 100 Stat. 2095 [Oct. 22, 1986]).\\

Title 26 provides for the conditions under which the IRS may disclose Federal Tax Returns and Return Information (\gls{FTI}) to other agencies, including the Census Bureau.
